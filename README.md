# Nasa-Turbo-Jet-Engine-Failure-Prediction

## Introduction
Equipment maintenance costs are a significant concern, especially when repairing failed equipment can skyrocket the expenses. In mission-critical scenarios, like operating NASA Turbo Jets, ensuring reliable and efficient functioning is paramount. This project aims to leverage predictive maintenance, using historical data, to foresee potential equipment failures, thereby reducing unplanned downtimes and associated costs.

## Objective
The goal is to create a predictive model that can alert potential failures in NASA Turbo Jets, ensuring timely maintenance and thus improved overall reliability.

## Workflow

### Data Wrangling and EDA
- Understand the data and its intricacies.
- Clean and transform data to a suitable format.
- Handle missing values and identify outliers.

### Model Development
- Apply machine learning techniques: regression, classification, or time-series analysis.
- Train the model on historical NASA Turbo Jet data to predict impending failures.

### Model Evaluation
- Use criteria like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve for evaluation.
- Consider model complexity, interpretability, and prediction time for real-world applicability.

### Deployment
- Integrate the best model into a production environment.
- Monitor NASA Turbo Jets in real-time and provide early warnings for potential failures.

## Benefits
By proactively addressing equipment maintenance using this predictive model:
- Downtime is reduced.
- Repair costs are lowered.
- Overall equipment reliability and efficiency are improved.

## Conclusion
The Nasa-Turbo-Jet-Engine-Failure-Prediction project offers an advanced solution to drastically cut down on maintenance costs and ensure the utmost efficiency of NASA Turbo Jets by predicting potential failures well in advance.
