# Nasa-Turbo-Jet-Engine-Failure-Prediction

Equipment maintenance costs can be quite high, but the cost of repairing a failed piece of equipment can be mind-bogglingly expensive. Therefore, it's essential to perform timely maintenance to keep the equipment in good working order. This is especially important for critical equipment like NASA Turbo Jets, which must operate reliably and efficiently to ensure mission success.

One approach to reducing the cost of equipment maintenance is to use predictive maintenance. By analyzing historical data from the equipment, we can build a model that predicts when a failure is likely to occur. This allows us to perform maintenance before the equipment fails, reducing the likelihood of unplanned downtime and the associated costs.

To build a failure prediction model for NASA Turbo Jets, we will start with data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify any issues. This may involve cleaning and transforming the data, dealing with missing values, and identifying any outliers or anomalies in the data.

Next, we will build a predictive model using machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, or time-series analysis. We will train the model on historical data from the NASA Turbo Jets and use it to predict when a failure is likely to occur.

We will evaluate the performance of the model based on several criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We will also consider the model's complexity, interpretability, and prediction time, as these factors can impact the model's usefulness in a real-world setting.

Once we have selected the best model, we will deploy it to a production environment, where it will be used to monitor the NASA Turbo Jets and provide early warning of potential failures. By taking a proactive approach to equipment maintenance, we can reduce downtime, lower repair costs, and improve overall equipment reliability and efficiency.
