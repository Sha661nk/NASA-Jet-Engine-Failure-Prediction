**Nasa-Turbo-Jet-Engine-Failure-Prediction**  
A predictive maintenance solution designed to preemptively address failures in NASA Turbo Jets. Utilizing historical data, this project encompasses data wrangling, EDA, machine learning (including regression, classification, and time-series analysis), and model evaluation. The end goal is to deploy a robust model that not only forecasts potential failures but also enhances overall jet reliability and efficiency.
